# Power-BI-Reports

Following are the screenshots of the 3 Power BI reports I developed for three different target audiences in Australia: 

Retail Owners: Retail owners could visulaize profit generated by the store name and city in which the store is. They can also look at the number of employees, type of store and head office location of the store.

Retail Associations: Retail associations can look up to state level employee counts, retail revenue and average shopping time in minutes. They can filter out on the store to identify which government handles the store to communicate regarding funding or support.

Government: The government gets the high level of each state: Monthly GST paid by each state, average payrate of business in the states, and monthly net profit by state. It also helps the government to dive down into individual businesses to check the ratio of non-vaccinated employees and employees showing symptoms of covid.
